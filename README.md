# List of all Swedish words

This repo contains a list of all Swedish words. I haven't been able to find a good list of Swedish words so I decided to create my own. I did this by taking the data set [SALDO](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/resurser/saldo) and removed some of the words, and all metadata associated with the words. What is left is the file `ord.txt`. There are still some inconsistensies caused by the machine filtering, but the list should be good enough for most uses..
